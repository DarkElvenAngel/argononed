# ARCH AUR

  I'm not the maintainer of these package and have no direct way to contact who is, I'm adding a patch for [argonone-c-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/argonone-c-git).

This will fix kernel issues where the user doesn't have access to the `/dev/vcio` and the build must use the `USE_SYSFS_TEMP` build flag.  It's my hope these changes find there way into the AUR and I can help with any questions to improve farther.

## Note

I'm not the original author of this package and am not a regular user of Arch Linux, as such I have no wish to take over as maintainer.

# Argon One Daemon

A replacement daemon for the Argon One Raspberry Pi cases, and the Argon Artik Fan Hat.

## How To Install

Firstly you need to have a build environment setup, that includes the following `gcc dtc git bash linux-headers make`  
*NOTE : The package names will be different depending on your OS so I've only given their binary names. Refer to your distribution for what you need to install.*  

I've tried to make the installer as simple as possible. After cloning this repo simply run ```./install``` You may need to reboot for full functionality.

## Configuration

Configuration is all done in the **/boot/config.txt** look for this line ```dtoverlay=argonone``` The parameters are simple.

* **fantemp[0-2]** - Sets the temperatures at which the fan will spin up
* **fanspeed[0-2]** - Sets the speed at which the fan will spin
* **hysteresis** - Sets the hysteresis

The default values are the same as the OEM at 55℃ the fan will start at 10%, at 60℃ the speed will increase to 55% and finally after 65℃ the fan will spin at 100%.  The default hysteresis is 3℃

### Example config.txt

In this example the hysteresis will be set to 5 and the fan will start at 50℃

```text
dtoverlay=argonone,hysteresis=5
dtparam=fantemp0=50
```

## Why make this?

Simply put I didn't like the OEM software.  It works sure but it uses Python and needs to install a bunch of dependencies.  This makes it's foot print on your system much bigger than it needs to be.  My daemon runs with minimal requirements, all of them are included in this Repo.

## OS Support

The installer now requires you to run ```./configure``` before you run make. This will set up the installer so that it should be able to install on multiple OS's.  The current list of supported OS's are  

* Raspberry Pi OS 32bit or 64bit
* RetroPi
* Gentoo
* Manjaro-arm
* Arch Linux arm (ARMv7 installation ONLY) [aarch64/AUR](OS/archarm/README.md)
* Ubuntu
* OSMC
* TwisterOS
* DietPI
* Pop OS
* Kali Linux
* AlmaLinux Thanks to @ArclightMat
* Void Linux
* Lakka *\**
* LibreElec *\**
* [OpenWRT](OS/openwrt/README.md) **EXPERIMENTAL** *\**
* [Alpine Linux](OS/alpine/README.md) **SEE LINK**
* opensuse Thanks to @fridrich
* opensuse-microos **EXPERIMENTAL**
* piCore Thanks to @irkode **0.4.x ONLY see note** *\***
* [NixOS](OS/nixos/README.md) **SPECIAL** _(Please see link for this OS)_ Thanks to @ykis-0-0 for all the hard work required for this one

If your OS isn't on this list it means that the installer isn't setup for your OS and it *may* or *may not* be able to install on your system.  Support for your OS may be avalible in [0.4.x branch](https://gitlab.com/DarkElvenAngel/argononed/-/tree/0.4.x)

*\** *Support for this OS is with the self extracting package system. SEE BELOW*

*\*** *Support for this OS is only with the newer 0.4.x branch, you must manually switch branches*

## Logging Options

The default build will generate a very detailed logs if you want less logging then add  
```make LOGLEVEL=[0-6]```  
The log levels go in this order: FATAL, CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG. A value of 0 disables logging.

## Advanced Build Options

 Advanced Build options are used with `configure` or `package.sh`

 **USE_SYSFS_TEMP** If your system doesn't have `/dev/vcio` you'll need to use the sysfs temperature sensor set. Set the path for your OS not all systems store this in the same place. example  `USE_SYSFS_TEMP=/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon1/temp1_input`

 **DISABLE_POWERBUTTON** if you don't have `/dev/gpiochip0` or you don't want to use the power button then use this flag.  Remember that the Force shutdown >= 5 second long press will still work.

 **RUN_IN_FOREGROUND** if you need the daemon to always run in the foreground this flag will skip the forking to the background and cause the daemon to log to the console.

## Upgrading to the latest version

In order to upgrade to the latest version the current method is to pull the updates from gitlab and execute the following command

```text
./install
```

## The Argon One CLI tool

This is the new command line tool that lets you change setting on the fly. It communicates with shared memory of the daemon, so the daemon must be running for this tool to be of use. It also introduced new modes for the daemon such as Cool Down and Manual control over the fan.

### Cool Down Mode

In cool down mode the fan has a set temperature you want to reach before switching back to automatic control.  This is all set as follows   ```argonone-cli --cooldown <TEMP> [--fan <SPEED>]```  
***NOTE***: *The speed is optional and the default is 10% it's also import to note that if the temperature continues to climb the schedules set for the fan are ignored.*  

### Manual Mode  

As the name implies your in control over the fan the schedules are ignored.  To access this as follows ```argonone-cli --manual [--fan <SPEED>]```  
***NOTE***: *The fan speed is optional and if not set the fans speed is left alone.*

### Auto Mode

This is the default mode the daemon always starts in this mode and will follow the schedules in the setting.  If you want to change to automatic you do so as follows ```argonone-cli --auto```

### Off Mode

Yes an off switch, maybe you want to do something and you need to be sure the fan doesn't turn on and spoil it.  You can turn off the fan as follows ```argonone-cli --off```
***NOTE***: *When the fan is off nothing but turning to a different mode will turn it back on*

## Setting setpoints

Want to adjust the when the fan comes on, maybe it's not staying on long enough you can change all set points in the schedules from the command line **without** rebooting.  the values are fan[0-2] temp[0-2] and hysteresis.  It's important when changing these values that you remember that the daemon will reject bad values and/or change them to something else.  It's also important to commit the changes you make otherwise they won't do anything.  The value rules are simple each stage must to greater than the one before it and there are minimum and max values.  
For temperature the minimum value is 30° the maximum is currently undefined.  
For the fan the minimum speed is 10% and the maximum is 100%.  
For Hysteresis the minimum is 0° and the maximum is 10°  

You can set your values like in this example.  
```argonone-cli --fan0 25 --temp0 50 --hysteresis 10 --commit```  
**OR**  

```text
argonone-cli --fan0 25
argonone-cli --temp0 50
argonone-cli --hysteresis 10
argonone-cli --commit
```

The changes don't have to made in one shot but you **MUST** commit them for them to take effect.

## Package System

This isn't a traditional package system for mainstream OS support this is meant to make an installer for an OS that otherwise isn't able to build the project locally.

To generate a package you need to follow this procedure.

```text
make mrproper
TARGET_DISTRO=<NAME OF DISTRO> ./package.sh
```

If successful the package will be in the build directory.

### Docker solution for packager

I have a docker solution for building packages read about it [here](docker/README.md)

## Argon Artik Hat

If you have an Argon Artik Hat and you see these error message:  

`Failed to load HAT overlay`

`dterror: not a valid FDT - err - 9`  

Check out my [firmware fix](firmware/README.md).
